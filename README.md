# ZEECA
## ZK & TEE Enabled Enforce Compliance Agent

ZEECA is a blockchain solution that automates the enforcement of Web2 compliance data into Web3 actions. It securely processes sensitive real-world information and executes corresponding on-chain actions while maintaining data privacy.

## üåü Features

- **Automated Compliance Bridge**: Converts Web2 legal decisions and private data into automated blockchain actions
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Combines zkTLS and TEE technology for secure data handling
- **Trustless Verification**: Validates compliance without exposing sensitive information

## üõ† Tech Stack

- LangChain Web Agents
- Coinbase AgentsSDK
- Phala Network TEE
- zkTLS
- Smart Contracts

## üèó Execution Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Web2 Data Sources] --> B[LangChain Web Agents]
    B --> C[Coinbase Agents]
    C --> D[zkTLS Proof Generation]
    D --> E[On-Chain Verification]
    E --> F[Smart Contract Execution]
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Data Discovery & Validation**
   - LangChain Web Agents scan and parse Web2 sources
   - Agents validate data authenticity
   - Results are processed within TEE environment [implementation is not yet complete]

2. **Proof Generation & Verification**
   - Coinbase Agents SDK generates zkTLS proofs
   - Smart contracts verify proofs on-chain

3. **On-Chain Execution**
   - Verified proofs trigger smart contract actions
   - Actions execute based on validated Web2 data

## üí° Use Cases

- Legal compliance automation
- Private voting enforcement
- Regulatory compliance
- Performance-based crowdfunding execution


## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [CDP API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key)
- Poetry package manager

### 1. Set Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables required for Coinbase AgentKit:

- Ensure the following ENV Vars are set:
  - "CDP_API_KEY_NAME=<your-cdp-api-key-name>"
  - "CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-cdp-api-key-private-key>"
  - "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>"
  - "NETWORK_ID=base-sepolia"

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd cdp-agentkit/cdp-langchain/examples/zeeca
poetry install
poetry run python zeeca.py
```

## Example Task

The agents performs an automated analysis of election results and takes actions based on the outcome. The process involves:

1. Election Results Analysis
   - Analyze CNN's election results page
   - Report vote counts, state results, and electoral distribution

2. Party-Specific Analysis
   - If Republicans lead: Analyze GOP website
   - If Democrats lead: Analyze Democratic party website
   - If unclear: Check Politico for expert analysis

3. Post-Victory Actions (if Republican victory)
   - Request test funds from faucet
   - Generate and verify zkTls proof
   - Mint commemorative NFT
   - Provide transaction details

The agents should provide detailed observations, reasoning, and outcomes for each step in markdown format, while avoiding direct content reproduction from source URLs.

See [ZECA Results of the Task](./cdp-agentkit/cdp-langchain/examples/zeeca/README.md) for more details.

## ZEECA Applications

### ü§ñ Agent Capabilities
ZEECA agents can aggregate multiple data points and execute actions based on single or combined criteria. Agents continuously monitor, validate, and execute actions when predefined conditions are met.

### üîÑ Automated Actions Based On:

1. **Single Criterion**
2. **Multiple Criteria**
3. **Aggregated Data**

**Example Multi-Criteria Triggers:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Multiple Data Sources] --> B[Agent Analysis]
    B --> C{Criteria Check}
    C -->|Single Criterion| D[Simple Action]
    C -->|Multiple Criteria| E[Complex Action]
    C -->|Aggregated Data| F[Composite Action]
```
